An add-on for Gina Trapani's [todo.txt][todotxt] script, allowing the automatic addition of
recurring tasks to the todo list.

Once installed, the `todo.sh recur` command should be run from a `cron` job (or other scheduler), once a day.  Any tasks applicable to
the current date will be appended to the todo list (if they're not already present).

The recurring tasks are pulled from a `recur.txt` file, living in the same directory as `todo.txt`.  Each line in `recur.txt` has
the syntax:

    [week[,week ...] ] day : task
    
or

    daily: task    

Where:

- `week` is an optional list of weeks - "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth" or "last".  Weeks are separated by
commas __only__ (no spaces).
- `day` is __one__ of "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday" or "sunday".  If a task needs to happen
on two different days of the week, you'll need two lines.
- `task` is anything that might appear in a [todo.txt][todotxt] task, including priority, contexts or projects.  Do *not* include
an added-on date, however.

## Examples:

    sunday: (A) Weekly review of projects list
    monday: Take out the trash @home
    last saturday: Apply the dog's flea medicine
    first,third friday: Collect and file expenses
    daily: run the dishwasher

Note that the add-on attempts to be smart about things, so if you ran this on a Sunday when `todo.txt` already contained:

    (B) Weekly review of projects list @home

It would notice the task with the same text (ignoring priority, context, project) and add nothing.

## Installation:

Download the latest [recur archive][tarball], and unpack it in a temporary directory, e.g.

    tar zxf recur.1.2.3.tar.gz
    cd recur

If you are using the standard `todo.sh` location for add-ons (`$HOME/.todo.actions.d`), you'll want to run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

to install the recur script and its component modules.

If your add-ons live elsewhere, you'll need to specify that directory as an `INSTALLSITESCRIPT` option when generating the Makefile.

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITESCRIPT=/some/other/directory
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

(Installing the modules in a user-specific directory, rather than system-wide, calls for setting `LIB=` as appropriate, and is left as
an exercise for the reader.)

See the general [Creating and Installing Add-Ons][installing] documention to learn where your add-ons live if you're unsure.
